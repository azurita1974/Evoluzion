Evoluzion
=========

evoluzion is a genetic evolution simulator made in java.

Evoluzion was build with Libgdx-0.9.9 (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) Java game library and edited with Eclipse 4.2.2 SDK (https://www.eclipse.org/).

I assume that you already know how to work with Eclipse. 

I'm using JAVA-JDK-7 and Java compiler 1.6 

To use this source code, download these folders to your Eclipse-Workspace:

EvoluZion :  working directory where I made the logic of the program.
EvoluZion-android: used to work in android.
EvoluZion-descktop: it  has the Main Class that starts the program in desktop computers.


Start Eclipse, go to File>Import and select the option General>Existent project into Workspace.

Import the folders one by one.

Because the structure of Libgdx, the folder “Evolution-android/assets/data”, carries the png images and others files used for the program.

I never tested the program in android but it should work with minimal tweaks.

To make a executable jar file go to “File>export”, select “Java>runnable jar file” and follow the instructions.
